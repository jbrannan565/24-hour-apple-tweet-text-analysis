# 24-hour-apple-tweet-text-analysis
 In this project we will explore a data set of tweets about Apple computers over the course of 24 hours. We are interested in discerning whether there is a difference between tweets that were liked or retweeted and those that were not. If there is a discernable difference, we will attempt to create a model that can predict whether a tweet was interacted with from data within the set.
 The data set is included in a zip file and can also be found here:
